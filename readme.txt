Improve page speed by replacing embedded Youtube and Vimeo videos with a clickable preview image. Visitors simply click on the image to play the video.

== Description ==

This plugin improves page load time and increases your Google PageSpeed Score. It works with oEmbed and replaces embedded Youtube and Vimeo videos with a clickable preview image.
By loading videos only when the user clicks on the preview image, no unnecessary JavaScript is loaded. Especially on sites with many embedded videos this will make your visitors happy. Additionally, all Youtube videos are loaded in a privacy-enhanced mode using the "https://www.youtube-nocookie.com" embed URL.

This plugin works for your existing YouTube and Vimeo blocks. No vendor lock-in and no custom shortcodes: Easily turn the plugin on and off anytime.

Demo on the developer’s website: [www.kweber.com/lazy-load-videos/](https://www.kweber.com/lazy-load-videos/)

If you have created your own language pack, or have an update of an existing one, you can [send me](https://www.kweber.com/contact/) your gettext PO and MO so that I can bundle it into my plugin. You can download the latest POT file [from here](https://plugins.svn.wordpress.org/lazy-load-for-videos/trunk/languages/lazy-load-for-videos.pot).


== Installation ==

Upload Lazy Load for Videos into you plugin directory (/wp-content/plugins/) and activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress.

When you had already published videos before you have activated Lazy Load for Videos, update all posts by clicking the "Update Posts" button below the "Save Changes" button.

You may have to clean the website's and browser's cache.

If you don't see a preview image instead of the Youtube/Vimeo video, open the post editor and update/save the post again or even update all posts using the above mentioned "Update Posts" button.

Optionally: Sign up to the Lazy Load for Videos newsletter to get notified about major updates.

NOTICE - this is important to make your videos work as expected:
Easily insert the URL to your content (e.g. Youtube video) into a post or page. The URL must be on its own line and must not be hyperlinked. "WordPress will automatically turn [the URL] into a YouTube embed when the post is viewed." (Source: https://codex.wordpress.org/Embeds)
Inserting a Youtube iframe (instead of the plain URL) is deprecated and not supported by Lazy Load for Videos.


== Frequently Asked Questions ==

Search for keywords using "STRG + F" keyboard shortcut (Mac: "CMD + F").

= Where can I see this plugin in use? =
For example, on [www.kweber.com/lazy-load-videos/](https://www.kweber.com/lazy-load-videos/).

= Which video platforms are supported? =
Videos from the biggest video platform, Youtube (https://youtube.com), and Vimeo (https://vimeo.com) are supported.

= The plugin isn't working with Jetpack... =
"Jetpack" by WordPress.com offers some useful extensions. Only one of them makes Lazy Load for Videos break – the "Shortcode Embeds" extension. So simply disable the extension. (In order to see a "Deactivate" button for "Shortcode Embeds" on the Jetpack's extension overview, you must click on "Learn More".)

= Does the Lazy Load for Videos plugin work when there is more than one video on the same page? =
Yes. The plugin works on single posts and pages as well as on archive pages with several posts and videos.

= Should I use the Lazy Load for Videos plugin? =
Yes!

= Why? =
* If you want to speed your site up, this plugin is for you. Especially on sites with many embedded videos this plugin is gold. There are manz reasons why you should make your site faster, see next question.
* The plugin is really lightweight, has no dependencies and does neither blow your performance nor your database up.
* By loading the videos only when the user clicks on the preview image, no unnecessary JavaScript is loaded. You may know this issue: (Defer) Parsing of JavaScript. "In order to load a page, the browser must parse the contents of all <script> tags, which adds additional time to the page load. By minimizing the amount of JavaScript needed to render the page, and deferring parsing of unneeded JavaScript until it needs to be executed, you can reduce the initial load time of your page." (Source: https://developers.google.com/speed/docs/best-practices/mobile#DeferParsingJS)
* Video preview and play button are scalable and optimized for mobile devices.
* Finally, Lazy Load for Videos is really easy to use. Simply upload and activate the plugin.

= Why are a faster website and a higher Google PageSpeed Score great? =
* Search engines, especially Google, love speedy sites! So you will be higher ranked in search results.
* Consequently, you get more visitors.
* Fast sites lead to higher visitor engagement and returning visitors.
* Faster sites increase conversions.
* Potentially more $$ for your business!

= How can I calculate my Google PageSpeed Score? =
PageSpeed Insights is a service by Google to help you optimize your site's performance. You can analyse your site using a browser extension or online, more information: https://developers.google.com/speed/pagespeed/

= How to embed videos in WordPress? =
Easily insert the URL to your content (e.g. Youtube video) into a post or page. The URL must be on its own line and must not be hyperlinked. "WordPress will automatically turn [the URL] into a YouTube embed when the post is viewed." (Source: https://codex.wordpress.org/Embeds)
Inserting a Youtube `<iframe>` (instead of the plain URL) is deprecated and not supported by Lazy Load for Videos.

= How to disable lazy-loading of a single video? =
Append `&lazyload=0` to the video URL.

= How to add support for custom post types? =
UPDATE: Since plugin version 2.1.2, every custom post type is supported automatically. So you can ignore the following instructions. They will be removed with one of the next updates.

You can use a filter to add support for a custom post type (since version 2.0.4).
Replace 'post_type_label' with the name/label of your custom post type.

`/**
 * Set post types that shall support Lazy Load for Videos
 */
function lazyload_videos_set_post_types( $post_types ) {
	$post_types[] = 'post_type_label';
	return $post_types;
}
add_action( 'lazyload_videos_post_types', 'lazyload_videos_set_post_types' );`

= How to use a custom play button? =
For now, you can choose the "Youtube button image" from the play button drop-down list, then add the following custom CSS that includes a link to your custom CSS play button image:

```
.preview-youtube .lazy-load-youtube-div, .lazy-load-vimeo-div {
	background-image: url(INSERT-YOUR-URL-HERE.../images/play.png);
}
```

Feature versions might include an option to change the colour of your CSS-only buttons using a colour picker and might also include an option to directly upload the desired button image.

= How to lazy load playlists? =
Similar to a single video, insert the playlist URL in the following format:
`https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dkfQFih23Ak&list=PLRQFBJ3mkjnxaPhAVOzjxxv_0yr8XE0Ja` (the other format - `https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=...` - is not supported currently).
Note that playlists are not working when you're using the pre-/post-roll feature.

= Known bugs - this plugin may not work correctly when one of the following plugins is activated... =
* "YouTube" (https://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/youtube-embed-plus/)
* "Shortcode Embeds" extension within Jetpack, see answer above (https://jetpack.me/support/shortcode-embeds/)
* "BuddyPress" (https://wordpress.org/plugins/buddypress/)
* Thumbnails from Vimeo videos in "Privacy Mode" are not supported because Vimeo’s API doesn’t deliver thumbnails for those videos.
* [???]

* Escape video title and attribute texts so that they can be rendered when containing quotes

= 2.16.1 =
